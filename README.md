MATLAB codes (.m files) and input data (.dat/.txt files) used in the study of Chowdhury et al. (2021, PNAS, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2105746118)

PLEASE CITE THE ARTICLE WHEN USING ONE OF THE CODES GIVEN BELOW

The codes and input files given here can reproduce the following figures presented in the study:

1. Figure 3b & SI Appendix Figure S4

    Description: models the trace-element partitioning between melt-residue during melting, and also compares the modelled melt compositions with the Singhbhum Craton TTGs.

2. Figure 3c
   
    Description: performs statiscal analyses of the La/Yb based thicknesses as a function of time. Thickness data are in SI Appendix Data Table S2. 

3. SI Appendix Figure S3

    Dscription: performs statiscal analyses of various compositional parameters of the Singhbhum TTGs as a function of time. Raw data are in SI Appendix Data Table S2. 

4. SI Appendix Figure S5

    Dscription: performs statiscal analyses of the trace element compositions of the Singhbhum K-granites. Raw data are in SI Appendix Data Table S2.

5. Figure 4 & SI Appendix Figs. S6-S7

    Description: performs isostasy calculations, and also shows the temporal evolution of different input parameters (e.g., cratonic crustal thickness and density; CLM thickness) used in the model. 
    
See SI Appendix Methods for the details of the modelling approaches and statistical analyses.
